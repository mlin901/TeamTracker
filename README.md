## Description

The TeamTracker CMS enables you to view, add, and remove employees, departments, and roles. It also enables you to see salary expeditures for different departments. TeamTracker is built using the following technologies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which is the JavaScript runtime used for the server.
- The [mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) npm package (a "Node.js driver for MySQL) to interface with the MySQL database.
- The [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) npm package for prompting users for input.
- The [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) npm package to format tables written to the console.
- The [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) npm package to hide user and password information for MySQL.

TeamTracker accesses a MySQL database named teamtrack_db. The code to create and use this database is in /db/teatrackDB.sql. Code to seed this database is in /db/seeds.sql, which can be run by using the following command:
```
   node ./db/seeds.sql
```
